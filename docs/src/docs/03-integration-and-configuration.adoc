== Integration and configuration

=== How to implement OIL on your site

Setting up OIL on your page consists of the following steps:

** Add the oil.js javascript snippet to your page
** Add a configuration block to your pages DOM

OIL creates a standard for the Opt-In but can't automatically stop your site from tracking your users. So to actually make your page respond to opt-ins you also need to do the following.

** Make sure your page doesn't track the user in its default state.
** Use Tealium for all tracking activities and use the loading rules we provide
** Listen to OIL events for loading non-Tealium tags, after the user opted in.

==== Adding oil.js to your site via Tealium (recommended)

Axel Springer Tealium needs to configure your site to inherit the predefined lib-dip-optin library profile. Once this is in place you publish those changes in the following way:

* Open your Tealium profile and go to "extensions"
* Find the entry for "AS Opt-in Overlay", you'll be noticed of a change to this extension
* Publish / deploy your profile to activate the changes to Oil.js

This needs to be repeated for every new version of OIL. The library profile can't push new code to your website without your action.

==== Adding oil.js to your site via direct integration

If Tealium can't be used on your site you also can add OIL directly from our CDN.

Example (replace with the latest version):
[source, html, subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;script>
include::../../../dist/oilstub.{version}.min.js[]
&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://oil.axelspringer.com/release/{version_raw}/oil.{version}.min.js">&lt;/script>
----

Updated versions of the script will be deployed using a different filename hence we'll never alter an existing version.

Please make sure you're working with the *latest version* available.

Please check https://oil.axelspringer.com/release for further updates. Choose the latest version or the version fitting to this documentation. Normalley there will be multiple files:

* oil.1.0.34-RELEASE.min.js - *This is the file you will need to reference in your website*
* hub.1.0.34-RELEASE.min.js
* Chunks, beginning with numbers - they will ne loaded asynchronously and you don't need to do anything with them.
** 0.1.0.34-RELEASE.chunk.js
** X.1.0.34-RELEASE.chunk.js


IMPORTANT: Your domain needs to be whitelisted in order to work with OIL (contact us to get whitelisted: OIL Support <oil-support@axelspringer.com>)

=== Configuring OIL

OIL comes with a wide range of customisation features which can be configured via a configuration block. Put the configuration object somewhere in the upper part of your page. Please disable the preview mode for the first production test. The preview mode hides the OIL layer except you enable it on your browser session. See the parameter section below for more details.

OIL also comes with a default configuration, that will support Single Opt-In with a German standard text.

==== SOI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. This is an example SOI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<!-- Text labels, see Label Keys section below -->
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": false,
    "label_intro_heading": "Please confirm",
    "locale": "enEN_01"
  }
</script>
----

==== POI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. Give extra attention to the configuration, if you want to use POI, which needs the additional POI configuration added and tailored to your situation. Contact us, if you need help. This is an example POI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": false,
    /*
        Text labels, see Label Keys section below
    */
    "label_intro_heading": "Please confirm",
    /*
        POI optional params start here
    */
    "poi_activate_poi": true,
    "poi_hub_origin": "//oil.axelspringer.com",
    "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
    "poi_subscriber_set_cookie": true,
    "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName"
    "locale": "enEN_01"
  }
</script>
----

POI can be partitioned in different groups using a prefix or group name. You need to use the same group name as every other unit in your group. This is not an optional parameter.
Only group names configured by Axel Springer are allowed.

==== Auto-Hiding the layer (timeout)

If you do not interact with the Opt-In Layer, it will autohide after a fixed time. If you want to disable the feature, you need to edit the <<config-timeout,configuration>> and the set the value to 0 or -1. If you click on any navigation link in the Opt-In Layer the timeout will be canceled. The default timeout is:
