== Quickstart

=== Minimal setup

* Add your <<configuring-oil,configuration>> tag, for example:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "publicPath": "//my.server",
    "locale_url": "//my.server/myLocale.json"
  }
</script>
----
* Add OIL and the CMP-stub to your website, with a tag manager like <<adding-oil-js-to-your-site-via-tealium-recommended,tealium>> or <<adding-oil-js-to-your-site-via-direct-integration,directly>> as a tag, i.e.:

[source, html, subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;script>
include::../../../dist/oilstub.{version}.min.js[]
&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://oil.axelspringer.com/release/{version_raw}/oil.{version}.min.js">&lt;/script>
----



* <<styling-guide,Style>> your layer according to your style guide
* Create your own <<locale-object,language pack>>

=== How to implement OIL on your site

Setting up OIL on your page consists of the following steps:

** Add the oil.js javascript snippet to your page
** Add a configuration block to your pages DOM

OIL creates a standard for the Opt-In but can't automatically stop your site from tracking your users. So to actually make your page respond to opt-ins you also need to do the following.

** Make sure your page doesn't track the user in its default state.
** Use Tealium for all tracking activities and use the loading rules we provide
** Listen to OIL events for loading non-Tealium tags, after the user opted in.

==== Adding oil.js to your site via Tealium (recommended)

Axel Springer Tealium needs to configure your site to inherit the predefined lib-dip-optin library profile. Once this is in place you publish those changes in the following way:

* Open your Tealium profile and go to "extensions"
* Find the entry for "AS Opt-in Overlay", you'll be noticed of a change to this extension
* Publish / deploy your profile to activate the changes to Oil.js

This needs to be repeated for every new version of OIL. The library profile can't push new code to your website without your action.

==== Adding oil.js to your site via direct integration

If Tealium can't be used on your site you also can add OIL directly from our CDN.

Example (replace with the latest version):
[source, html, subs="attributes"]
----
&lt;script>
include::../../../dist/oilstub.{version}.min.js[]
&lt;/script>
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="https://oil.axelspringer.com/release/{version_raw}/oil.{version}.min.js">&lt;/script>
----

Updated versions of the script will be deployed using a different filename hence we'll never alter an existing version.

Please make sure you're working with the *latest version* available.

Please check https://oil.axelspringer.com/release for further updates. Choose the latest version or the version fitting to this documentation. Normalley there will be multiple files:
