== OIL API

In addition to the configuration the host site can communicate with the OIL layer using its API. OIL, in its default state, never emits console errors.
To get a full log and all errors you can enable the verbose mode. For test deployments and A/B testing OIL supports a preview mode.

=== Test Deployment and Preview Mode
The preview mode is useful for testing OIL in a live environment without making it available to your end-users.

The preview mode is turned off by default, meaning OIL will be available to all your users. If you turn the preview mode on (please see configuration section), OIL won't be shown at first, but can be enabled for your current session on the browser's console:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOn();
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOff();
----

When preview mode is turned on some debug information will be seen on the browser console. See also "Verbose Logging" below for more detailed logging.

=== OIL Verbose Logging
OIL will show no logs, except in preview mode or verbose mode.

Run the following commands on the console of your browser to switch verbose logging on and off:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.verboseModeOn();
window.AS_OIL.verboseModeOff();
----

Debug mode can be turned on at any time, whereas the similar preview mode can only be enabled in the configuration, please see above.

Please note that verbose logging can only be activated for your own browser, all other users won't see those logs.

=== OIL JS-Calls

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3"]
|====
| API Call | Description
|window.AS_OIL.triggerOptIn(); | The user will opted in. It's the same behaviour as when the user is clicking Accept on the layer.
|window.AS_OIL.triggerOptOut(); | OIL will remove all cookies if triggered and therefore opt-out the user of everything, even POI.
|window.AS_OIL.reload(); | OIL will reload the configuration from the host's website.
|window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter(); | OIL will inject the Cookie Preference Center into your website. Please see "OIL CPC API" section.
|window.AS_OIL.applyGDPR(); | Sets gdprApplies variable to true and displays the layer if user hasn't opted-in. Useful in case you need to show the layer to a user from inside the EU and you're not a EU publisher.
|====

=== OIL Events

OIL is currently emitting the following events:

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3"]
|====
| Event name | Description
| oil_optin_done | When a users selects opt-in.
| oil_as_cpc_privacy_selected| When a user used the cpc and clicked opt-in.
| oil_click_advanced_settings| When a users clicks the advanced settings button/link.
| oil_click_back_to_main| When a user clicks the back link from the advanced settings page.
| oil_no_cookies_allowed| When a users has no cookies allowed and the no cookies layer is displayed
| oil_has_optedin| On every page reload, when the user has opted_in previously (OIL should be hidden)
| oil_shown| When oil is shown
| oil_hide_layer| When oil gets automatically hidden
| oil_click_thirdparty_list| When a user clicks the third party list link
| oil_click_company_list| When a user clicks the company list link
|====

To be informed about these events or to perform some activity everytime one of these events is fired you can register an event handler with
a callback to be executed. Here is an example how to do this:

[source,javascript]
----
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Cross browser event handler definition
    var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
    var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
    var eventer = window[eventMethod];

    // Callback to be executed when event is fired
    function receiveMessage(event) {
      function eventDataContains(str) {
        return JSON.stringify(event.data).indexOf(str) !== -1;
      }
      if (event && event.data && (eventDataContains('oil_optin_done') || eventDataContains('oil_has_optedin'))) {
        // Do something when event is fired...
        console.log("Do something when event is fired...");
      }
    }

    // Register event handler
    eventer(messageEvent, receiveMessage, false);
  </script>
----

=== OIL CPC API

You can add an integrated version of the OIL Cookie Preference Center to your page to give the user the chance to reverse his initial selection (or even Opt-Out).

For this include a div with the id below in your page:
[source,html]
----
<div id="oil-preference-center"></div>
----
To insert the OIL CPC in the prepared div, which you included in your page, execute this javascript snippet:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter();
----

For the action element to save the current setting there is an API endpoint:

[source,javascript]
----
window.oilTriggerOptin();
----

The inserted CPC will show the users current setting when inserted. Make sure OIL is part of the page first to make this work.

CPC API definition:

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3"]
|====
| Function Name | Description
| window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter() | inserts the CPC into the predefined div with the id #oil-preference-center into the host site
| window.AS_OIL.triggerOptIn() | will trigger the generic opt-in (can also result in an opt-out)
|====

=== Soft Blocking of DOM Elements
With OIL you can manage third-party scripts to ensure that they only run if the user has given consent to their use. For example, this is useful for scripts provided by
vendors that do not implement the IAB JavaScript API yet. Furthermore, OIL can manage other elements with a `src` or an `href` attribute the same way.


==== Managing `<script>` Elements

To manage `<script>` tags you have to add a `data-managed` attribute with the value `as-oil`. To avoid automatic execution of the `<script>` tag as long as it should be deactivated
change the `type` attribute to `opt-in` and add a `data-type` attribute with the original type. In case of tag activation OIL replaces the `type` attribute with this
original type. With an additional `data-purposes` attribute you can specify a comma-separated list of purpose ids the user has to consent with to activate the tag. If `data-purposes`
attribute is omitted all defined purposes are necessary for tag activation.

Here is an example for a managed `<script>` tag:
----
<script data-managed="as-oil"
        data-type="text/javascript"
        data-purposes="1,2,4"
        type="as-oil"
        id="managedScriptTag">
  document.getElementById("demoText").innerHTML = "This text will be shown with given consent!";
</script>
----
OIL can manage `<script>` tags that load a script from an URL as well. Simply replace the `src` attribute with `data-src` as shown below:
----
<script data-managed="as-oil"
        data-type="text/javascript"
        data-src="oilDemoScript.js"
        data-purposes="1,2,4"
        type="as-oil"
        id="managedScriptTag">
</script>
----
Attributes `class`, `id`, `defer`, `async` and `charset` and further `data-` attributes can be used. They are not changed by OIL.

==== Managing Other Elements

To manage elements with a `src` or `href` attribute add a `data-managed` attribute with the value `as-oil` and replace the `src` attribute with `data-src` or the `href`
attribute with `data-href`. With the optional `data-title` attribute a title can be defined - use it instead of `title` attribute. With a `data-purposes` attribute you
can specify a comma-separated list of purpose ids the user has to consent with to activate the tag. If `data-purposes` attribute is omitted all defined purposes are necessary for
tag activation. All other attributes are not changed by OIL - with one exception.
To ensure that managed elements are not visible as long as they should be deactivated OIL sets the CSS `display` property to `none`. To provide a value for this property that is
used when the tag is activated add a corresponding `data-display` attribute. OIL sets its value into the CSS display property when it activates the tag. Other CSS properties
can be specified by a `style` attribute or in a CSS section or file.

Here is an example for a managed `<img>` tag:

----
<img data-managed="as-oil"
         data-src="simpleImage.png"
         data-title="Simple Image"
         data-display="block"
         data-purposes="1,2,4"
         alt="A simple image"
         height="50"
         width="50"
         id="imgId"
         class="imgClass"
         style="border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 20px;">
----

=== Tracking and Google Analytics Events
If you want to use Google Analytics with OIL you can use OIL Events (see above) and proxy them to your specific GA installation.

This is an example script to subscribe to the event 'oil_optin_done' and forward it to Google Analytics. You might need to tweak it to your environment and needs.
[source,javascript]
----
// Multibrowser Support
var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
var eventer = window[eventMethod];

function receiveOptInMessage(event) {
  function eventDataContains(str) {
    return JSON.stringify(event.data).indexOf(str) !== -1;
  }
  if (window.ga && window.ga.loaded && event && event.data && eventDataContains('oil_optin_done')) { // event name
    var nonInteraction = true; // should be set to false for non-click events
    window.ga('send', 'event', 'OIL', 'oil_optin_done', {'nonInteraction': nonInteraction});
  }
}

eventer(messageEvent, receiveOptInMessage, false);
----

You can also use the global event queue to process events that have been fired before you declared the event listeners.
Therefore all events are stored in the global window.AS_OIL.eventCollection array. Every entry is an object including the event name and the timestamp when it has been fired.
[source,javascript]
----
if (window.AS_OIL.eventCollection && window.AS_OIL.eventCollection.length) {
    window.AS_OIL.eventCollection.forEach(function(item){
        // console.log(item.name);
        // console.log(item.timestamp);
        // use your tracking code to process every event that has been fired so far
        // example: Adobe tag manager
        _satellite.track(item.name)
    });
}

// event listener code, see above
