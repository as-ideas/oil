== OIL API

In addition to the configuration the host site can communicate with the OIL layer using its API. OIL, in its default state, never emits console errors.
To get a full log and all errors you can enable the verbose mode. For test deployments and A/B testing OIL supports a preview mode.

=== Test Deployment and Preview Mode
The preview mode is useful for testing OIL in a live environment without making it available to your end-users.

The preview mode is turned off by default, meaning OIL will be available to all your users. If you turn the preview mode on (please see configuration section), OIL won't be shown at first, but can be enabled for your current session on the browser's console:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOn();
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOff();
----

When preview mode is turned on some debug information will be seen on the browser console. See also "Verbose Logging" below for more detailed logging.

=== OIL Verbose Logging
OIL will show no logs, except in preview mode or verbose mode.

Run the following commands on the console of your browser to switch verbose logging on and off:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.verboseModeOn();
window.AS_OIL.verboseModeOff();
----

Debug mode can be turned on at any time, whereas the similar preview mode can only be enabled in the configuration, please see above.

Please note that verbose logging can only be activated for your own browser, all other users won't see those logs.

=== OIL JS-Calls

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3"]
|====
| API Call | Description
|window.AS_OIL.triggerOptIn(); | The user will opted in. It's the same behaviour as when the user is clicking Accept on the layer.
|window.AS_OIL.triggerOptOut(); | OIL will remove all cookies if triggered and therefore opt-out the user of everything, even POI.
|window.AS_OIL.reload(); | OIL will reload the configuration from the host's website.
|window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter(); | OIL will inject the Cookie Preference Center into your website. Please see "OIL CPC API" section.
|====

=== OIL Events

#2. Register an event handler with a callback to be executed when OIL fires the opt-in event or the user has opted in on an earlier occasion and revisits the page.
[source,javascript]
----
  <script type="text/javascript">
    // Cross browser event handler definition
    var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
    var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
    var eventer = window[eventMethod];

    // Callback to be executed when event is fired
    function receiveMessage(event) {
      function eventDataContains(str) {
        return JSON.stringify(event.data).indexOf(str) !== -1;
      }
      if (event && event.data && (eventDataContains('oil_optin_done') || eventDataContains('oil_has_optedin'))) {
        // Do something when event is fired...
        console.log("Do something when event is fired...");
      }
    }

    // Register event handler
    eventer(messageEvent, receiveMessage, false);
  </script>
----

=== OIL CPC API

You can add an integrated version of the OIL Cookie Preference Center to your page to give the user the chance to reverse his initial selection (or even Opt-Out).

For this include a div with the id below in your page:
[source,html]
----
<div id="oil-preference-center"></div>
----
To insert the OIL CPC in the prepared div, which you included in your page, execute this javascript snippet:
[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter();
----

For the action element to save the current setting there is an API endpoint:

[source,javascript]
----
window.oilTriggerOptin();
----

The inserted CPC will show the users current setting when inserted. Make sure OIL is part of the page first to make this work.

CPC API definition:

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3"]
|====
| Function Name | Description
| window.AS_OIL.showPreferenceCenter() | inserts the CPC into the predefined div with the id #oil-preference-center into the host site
| window.AS_OIL.triggerOptIn() | will trigger the generic opt-in (can also result in an opt-out)
|====

=== Tracking and Google Analytics Events
If you want to use Google Analytics with OIL you can use OIL Events (see above) and proxy them to your specific GA installation.

This is an example script to subscribe to the event 'oil_optin_done' and forward it to Google Analytics. You might need to tweak it to your environment and needs.
[source,javascript]
----
// Multibrowser Support
var eventMethod = window.addEventListener ? 'addEventListener' : 'attachEvent';
var messageEvent = eventMethod === 'attachEvent' ? 'onmessage' : 'message';
var eventer = window[eventMethod];

function receiveOptInMessage(event) {
  function eventDataContains(str) {
    return JSON.stringify(event.data).indexOf(str) !== -1;
  }
  if (window.ga && window.ga.loaded && event && event.data && eventDataContains('oil_optin_done')) { // event name
    var nonInteraction = true; // should be set to false for non-click events
    window.ga('send', 'event', 'OIL', 'oil_optin_done', {'nonInteraction': nonInteraction});
  }
}

eventer(messageEvent, receiveMessage, false);
