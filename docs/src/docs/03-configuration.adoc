== Configuration



=== Configuring OIL

OIL comes with a wide range of customisation features which can be configured via a configuration block. Put the configuration object somewhere in the upper part of your page. Please disable the preview mode for the first production test. The preview mode hides the OIL layer except you enable it on your browser session. See the <<functional-configuration-parameters,Functional configuration parameters>> section for more details.

OIL also comes with a default configuration that will support Single Opt-In but you will need to pass in your locale keys.

==== SOI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. This is an example SOI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": false,
    "locale": {
      "version": 1,
      "localeId": "enEN_01",
      "texts": {
        /* for a list of labels see below */
      }
    }
  }
</script>
----

==== POI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. Give extra attention to the configuration, if you want to use POI, which needs the additional POI configuration added and tailored to your situation. Contact us if you need help. This is an example POI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "poi_activate_poi": true,
    "poi_hub_origin": "//oil.axelspringer.com",
    "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
    "poi_subscriber_set_cookie": true,
    "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName",
    "locale": {
      /* see examples below */
    }
  }
</script>
----

POI can be partitioned in different groups using a prefix or group name. You need to use the same group name as every other unit in your group. This is not an optional parameter.
Only group names configured by Axel Springer are allowed.

*=required


[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3,1"]
|====
| Config Parameter | Description | Default Setting
| <<locale-object,locale*>> | Object including locale version, id and labels. You can define the standard labels for all legal texts and buttons and set a version for it. <<locale-object, See here for details>> | None
| publicPath* | The server path from which all chunks and ressources will be loaded. You should upload all released files there and configure it. | None, required
| preview_mode | The preview mode is useful when testing OIL in a production or live environment. As a dev you can trigger the overlay by setting a cookie named "oil_preview" with the value "true". This will show the OIL layer on your client. | false
| theme | The theme for the layer. By default there are two themes and size modifier themes, `dark` and `light` as well as `small dark` and `small light`. Themes currently work only as an additional css class. If you want to change the style or theme, please look into the styling guide in the development section. | light
| poi_activate_poi | Activates or disactivates Power Opt-In. Rememeber that you also have to setup the hub.js part if you do so, or you will endup with a non-working button. | false
| poi_hub_origin | The origin of the hub.js installation, if any. | //oil.axelspringer.com
| poi_hub_path | The path to the hub.html installation on the origin, if any. | /hub.html
| poi_group_name | POI group name. POI only affects those sites with the same group name (mandatory if POI is activated). The group name must be valid (existing). <<supported-poi-groups,Supported POI groups.>> | none
| poi_subscriber_set_cookie | Whether to set the SOI cookie on POI opt-ins or not. | true
| cookie_expires_in_days | Value in days until the domain cookie used to save the users decision in days | 31
| [[config-timeout]]timeout | Value in seconds until the opt-in layer will be automatically hidden. 0 or lower deactivates auto-hide. | 60
| advanced_settings | Replaces the No Button with a advanced settings button, which enables the user to select between different settings of privacy. The results of this selection is stored in the oil cookie (both SOI and POI) as well. | false
| persist_min_tracking | If minimum tracking should result in removing all OIL cookies from the users browser and close the layer and store this selection in the oil cookie. | true
| iabVendorListUrl | tbd | {embedded vendorlist}
| oilBackendUrl | (deprecated) The backend from where OIL can load locale-versions | https://oil-backend.herokuapp.com/oil
| iabVendorWhitelist | Array of vendor IDs to include in consent. If it is set, values in `iabVendorBlacklist` are ignored. <<blacklisting-and-whitelisting, Details here>> | none
| iabVendorBlacklist | Array of vendor IDs to exclude from consent <<blacklisting-and-whitelisting, Details here>> | None
| customPurposes | Array of custom purposes defined by publisher. IDs for custom purposes may range from 25-88. | none
| default_to_optin | Signal opt-in to vendors while still displaying the Opt-In layer to the end user | false
| advanced_settings_purposes_default | All purposes in the advanced settings layer should be activated by default | false
|====


=== Locale Object

The locale object must contain at least "localeId" and "version" along with the localized texts in the `texts` property.
LocaleId and version will be stored with the consent cookie so we can keep track of which explicit text version consent was granted for.
There are three options to pass a locale configuration into your application:

* Store your locale object as 'locale' in the oil.js configuration (lowest priority)

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "locale": {
    "localeId": "enEN_01",
    "version": 1,
    "texts": {
      "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

* Write your locale object directly to AS_OIL.CONFIG.LOCALE (middle priority)

```javascript
<script>
(function () {
    if (!window.AS_OIL) {
      window.AS_OIL = {};
      window.AS_OIL.CONFIG = {}
    }
    window.AS_OIL.CONFIG.locale = {
      "localeId": "enEN_01",
      "version": 1,
      "texts": {
        "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
      }
    };
  }()
)
</script>
```

* Return a JSON object from your server through locale_url configuration parameter (highest priority)

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "timeout": -1,
  "locale_url": "//www.yoursite.com/locale.json"
}
</script>
```

The recommended way is to keep the standard locale definitions.

==== Language label configuration

Language configuration goes in the `texts` object of the `locale` config parameter. These texts define the standard labels for all legal texts and buttons. For configurations with `advanced_settings=false` most of these labels are not needed.

Labels starting with `label_cpc_purpose_N` are automatically derived from the vendor list if missing from your locale object.

=== Blacklisting and Whitelisting

With *iabVendorWhitelist* and *iabVendorBlacklist* you can exclude specific vendors from the consent (blacklist) or include only the ones you want (whitelist). You can only use one method at the time - either whitelist or blacklist.

As an example, the vendorlist may contain vendors with vendor IDs 1 to 10. In the example the user accepts everything, he just pressed "OK". The consent-string would normally contain (by getVendorConsents) this data:

[source,javascript]
----
{
  "metadata": "consent-string",
  "purposeConsents": {
    "1": 1,
    "2": 1,
    "3": 1,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1
  },
  "vendorConsents": {
    "1": true,
    "2": true,
    "3": true,
    "4": true,
    "5": true,
    "6": true,
    "7": true,
    "8": true,
    "9": true,
    "10": true
  }
}
----

*Whitelist*: The whitelist contains IDs 3, 4, 5 in form of the configuration with `"iabVendorWhitelist": [3, 4, 5]`. If the user has given his consent by clicking on "OK" only vendors on the whitelist will be true.

  "vendorConsents": {

    "6": false,
    "7": false,
    "8": false,
    "9": false,
    "10": false
  }
}
----

*Blacklist*: The blacklist contains IDs 6, 7, 8 in form of the configuration with `"iabVendorBlacklist": [6, 7, 8]`. If the user has given his consent by clicking on "OK" only vendors NOT on the blacklist will be true.

    "7": false,
    "8": false,
    "9": true,
    "10": true
  }
}

==== Auto-Hiding the layer (timeout)

If you do not interact with the Opt-In Layer, it will autohide after a fixed time. If you want to disable the feature, you need to edit the <<config-timeout,configuration>> and the set the value to 0 or -1. If you click on any navigation link in the Opt-In Layer the timeout will be canceled. The default timeout is:
