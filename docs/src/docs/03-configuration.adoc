== Configuration



=== Configuring OIL

OIL comes with a wide range of customisation features which can be configured via a configuration block. Put the configuration object somewhere in the upper part of your page. Please disable the preview mode for the first production test. The preview mode hides the OIL layer except you enable it on your browser session. See the parameter section below for more details.

OIL also comes with a default configuration, that will support Single Opt-In with a German standard text.

==== SOI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. This is an example SOI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<!-- Text labels, see Label Keys section below -->
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": false,
    "label_intro_heading": "Please confirm",
    "locale": "enEN_01"
  }
</script>
----

==== POI configuration
You need to add the configuration snippet to all pages where OIL is required. Give extra attention to the configuration, if you want to use POI, which needs the additional POI configuration added and tailored to your situation. Contact us, if you need help. This is an example POI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "preview_mode": false,
    /*
        Text labels, see Label Keys section below
    */
    "label_intro_heading": "Please confirm",
    /*
        POI optional params start here
    */
    "poi_activate_poi": true,
    "poi_hub_origin": "//oil.axelspringer.com",
    "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
    "poi_subscriber_set_cookie": true,
    "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName",
    "locale": "enEN_01"
  }
</script>
----

POI can be partitioned in different groups using a prefix or group name. You need to use the same group name as every other unit in your group. This is not an optional parameter.
Only group names configured by Axel Springer are allowed.
