== Configuring OIL

OIL is configured using a simple JSON configuration block that you put in the upper part of your html.

=== The Configuration Block

Minimum configuration requires the parameters `config_version`, `publicPath` and `locale` or `locale_url`, so a minimal configuration block would look like this:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "config_version": 1,
    "publicPath": "my.server",
    "locale_url": "my.server/myLocale.json"
  }
</script>
----

Configuration version is a number. It will be stored with the consent cookie so we can keep track of which explicit configuration version consent was granted for.
Therefore, we recommend to increment this number everytime you change your OIL configuration.

==== locale_url or locale?

There are two ways to pass locale configuration to your OIL instance. One is the
configuration parameter `locale` which is expected to be an object, the other is `locale_url` signaling OIL to load that same configuration object from the given URL.
You can use whichever is better suited for you but make sure that one of the parameters is part of your configuration.

*See the <<functional-configuration-parameters,functional configuration parameters>> section for information on publicPath, locale_url, locale and all the other configuration parameters.*


=== Power Opt-In (POI) or Site Opt-In (SOI)?

Before integrating OIL, decide on whether to use Power Opt-In or Site Opt-In.
If you want to implement oil.js on a single site you only need the __Site Opt-In__ aka SOI and the above example is enough to make OIL work on your site.

What if you want to share consent across websites? That's when you need __Power Opt-In__ aka POI.

==== POI – Power Opt-In

To instantiate oil.js with POI activated, make up a name for your company group (in the example below `MyGroupName` is used), then follow these steps:

* Setup a server where the consent cookie is stored. For example `any.domain.com`.
* Upload `hub.html` from the `./release` folder, resulting in `https://any.domain.com/hub.html`
* Create a `MyGroupName.json` and upload it in a subfolder named `poi-lists` to your server, resulting in `https://any.domain.com/poi-lists/MyGroupName.json`. Note: The file name must be the same as the value passed in `poi_group_name`. For an example see <<poi-list, POI-List section>>. Note: Enable CORS for the `poi-lists` directory and its contained files.
* Make sure the `MyGroupName.json` is served with the right CORS-headers so that your websites are allowed to read it.
* Add the required parameters to each website configuration that should share the consent cookie:

[source,json]
----
  "poi_activate_poi": true,
  "poi_hub_origin": "//any.domain.com",
  "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
  "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName"
----

A single consent cookie will now be shared across sites that use the same `poi_hub_origin` and `poi_group_name` values. You can have multiple groups on the same domain.

Remember you are legally obliged to list all websites/companies belonging to one group.

Example minimal POI configuration:

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
  {
    "config_version": 1,
    "poi_activate_poi": true,
    "poi_hub_origin": "//any.domain.com",
    "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
    "poi_subscriber_set_cookie": true,
    "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName",
    "locale_url": "my.server/myLocale.json"
  }
</script>
----

==== POI-List

A POI-List file must be a json containing an object with a single property `companyList`. CompanyList must be an array of company names.

[source,json]
----
{
  "companyList": [
    "Foo Comp",
    "Bar Inc."
  ]
}
----

===== Group-wide vendor whitelist and vendor blacklist

Equal in function to the `iabVendorWhitelist` and `iabVendorBlacklist` configuration parameters you can limit vendor consent for every site that's part of your group.

To do this, you want to extend your POI-List with either one of those elements:

[source,json]
----
{
  "companyList": [
    "Super Comp"
  ],
  "iabVendorWhitelist": [1,2,3],
  "iabVendorBlacklist": [9,10]
}
----

**The values from the group-wide list override the values defined in a single site's configuration.** More information on what these parameters do, see the <<Blacklisting and Whitelisting>> section.


=== Configuration Parameters

This is a full list of configurable options.

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,3,1"]
|====

| <<auto-hiding-the-layer-timeout,timeout>> | Value in seconds until the opt-in layer will be automatically hidden. 0 or lower deactivates auto-hide. | 60
|====

=== Texts & Locale Object

The locale object must contain at least "localeId" and "version" along with the localized texts in the `texts` property.
LocaleId and version will be stored with the consent cookie so we can keep track of which explicit text version consent was granted for.
There are three options to pass a locale configuration into your application:

* Store your locale object as 'locale' in the oil.js configuration (lowest priority)

[source,json]
----
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "locale": {
    "localeId": "enEN_01",
    "version": 1,
    "texts": {
      "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
    }
  }
}
</script>
----

* Write your locale object directly to AS_OIL.CONFIG.LOCALE (middle priority)

```javascript
<script>
(function () {
    if (!window.AS_OIL) {
      window.AS_OIL = {};
      window.AS_OIL.CONFIG = {}
    }
    window.AS_OIL.CONFIG.locale = {
      "localeId": "enEN_01",
      "version": 1,
      "texts": {
        "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
      }
    };
  }()
)
</script>
```

* Return a JSON object from your server through locale_url configuration parameter (highest priority)

```json
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "timeout": -1,
  "locale_url": "//www.yoursite.com/locale.json"
}
</script>
```

The recommended way is to keep the standard locale definitions.

==== Language label configuration

Even though OIL is supposed to come with legal texts that shouldn't be altered, except the main heading, button labels and some additional texts, all labels can
be overwritten, even the default ones, in the OIL configuration block. Language configuration goes in the `texts` object of the `locale` config parameter.
The following table lists all label configuration parameters:

[width="100%",options="header", cols="1,2,3"]
|====
|Config Parameter| Description| Example Value
|label_intro_heading| The headline of the layer| We use cookies and other technologies
|label_intro| The text of the layer| We're using cookies, please confirm!
|label_button_yes| The label of the consent button| Yes

==== Special CSS classes within labels

There are multiple special CSS classes, which will get click handlers attached. If any element has these classes, they will work as links to the different pages of the layer. Currently there are these special css classes:

* **as-js-optin**: Will trigger an opt-in with SOI/POI depending on the current configuration.
* **as-js-optin-poi**: Will trigger an opt-in as POI.
* **as-js-companyList**: Will trigger the layer to show the company list.
* **as-js-thirdPartyList**: Will trigger the layer to show the 3rd party list.
* **as-js-advanced-settings**: Will trigger the layer to show the CPC (cookie preference center / advanced settings).
* **as-js-oilback**: Will trigger the layer to go back to the first view.

For example adding the class ``as-js-companyList`` will add a click handler, which will show the company list (group list):

```json
"label_intro": "I agree that <a href=\"javascript:void(0)\" class=\"as-oil__intro-txt--link as-js-companyList\">companies belonging to Group X</a> ...",

```


=== preview_mode

The preview mode is useful when testing OIL in a production or live environment. When in preview_mode, the consent layer remains hidden until you manually control its display using the following commands.

Run this in the console to show the OIL layer on your client:

[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOn();
----

To delete the cookie, run:

[source,javascript]
----
window.AS_OIL.previewModeOff();
----

When preview_mode is not set in configuration and no consent cookie is found, the layer will show for the visitor.


=== Blacklisting and Whitelisting

With *iabVendorWhitelist* and *iabVendorBlacklist* you can exclude specific vendors from the consent (blacklist) or include only the ones you want (whitelist). You can only use one method at a time - either whitelist or blacklist.

As an example, the vendor list may contain vendors with vendor IDs 1 to 10. In the example the user accepts everything, he just pressed "OK". The consent-string would normally contain (by getVendorConsents) this data:

.Default result from getVendorConsents without whitelist/blacklist
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "metadata": "consent-string",
  "purposeConsents": {
    "1": 1,
    "2": 1,
    "3": 1,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1
  },
  "vendorConsents": {
    "1": true,
    "2": true,
    "3": true,
    "4": true,
    "5": true,
    "6": true,
    "7": true,
    "8": true,
    "9": true,
    "10": true
  }
}
----

*Whitelist*: The whitelist contains IDs 3, 4, 5 in form of the configuration with `"iabVendorWhitelist": [3, 4, 5]`. If the user has given his consent by clicking on "OK" only vendors on the whitelist will be true.

.Result from getVendorConsents with whitelisting vendor IDs 3, 4, 5
[source,javascript]
----
{
  "metadata": "consent-string",
  "purposeConsents": {
    "1": 1,
    "2": 1,
    "3": 1,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1
  },
  "vendorConsents": {
    "1": false,
    "2": false,
    "3": true,
    "4": true,
    "5": true,
    "6": false,
    "7": false,
    "8": false,
    "9": false,
    "10": false
  }
}
----

*Blacklist*: The blacklist contains IDs 6, 7, 8 in form of the configuration with `"iabVendorBlacklist": [6, 7, 8]`. If the user has given his consent by clicking on "OK" only vendors NOT on the blacklist will be true.

.Result from getVendorConsents with blacklisting vendor IDs 6, 7, 8

----
{
  "metadata": "consent-string",
  "purposeConsents": {
    "1": 1,
    "2": 1,
    "3": 1,
    "4": 1,
    "5": 1
  },
  "vendorConsents": {
    "1": true,
    "2": true,
    "3": true,
    "4": true,
    "5": true,
    "6": false,
    "7": false,
    "8": false,
    "9": true,
    "10": true
  }
}
----


==== Auto-Hiding the layer (timeout)

If you do not interact with the Opt-In Layer, it will autohide after a fixed time. If you want to disable the feature, you need to edit the <<config-timeout,configuration>> and the set the value to 0 or -1. If you click on any navigation link in the Opt-In Layer the timeout will be canceled. The default timeout is:

[source,json]
----
include::../../../src/scripts/userview/userview_config.js[tags=config-timeout]
----

=== Custom vendors (non IAB vendors)
Custom vendors are vendors not supporting the IAB standard.
OIL.js supports a list of custom vendors. For each custom vendor you have to specify an Opt-In and an Opt-Out JavaScript snippet.
These snippets are evaluated when the user changes consent and on page load.
You can add custom vendors via a file similar to the original vendor list (see https://vendorlist.consensu.org/vendorlist.json). You need to specify a unique custom vendor id and decide for the purposes required by the custom vendor on your own.

* Please keep in mind that every change to the custom vendor list should result in an increase in the custom vendor list version.
* Enable CORS for the custom vendor list, if you host it on a different domain, e.g. for usage with POI.
