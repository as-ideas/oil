=== Solution Strategy

According the proposal of the European Commission, the European Parliament, and the Council of Ministers, a website is required to prompt users with a menu of privacy options when they are visiting for the first time.[1]

The Opt-In Layer (OIL) is our solution for these requirements consisting of three parts:

* A **subscriber** part, which adds the opt-in Layer to the host pages DOM and asks the user to opt-in.
* A **hub** part, which acts as a registry site for POI on a domain hosted by the content provider/publishder. This is optional and only needed for POI functionality.

Opt-In Information is stored in a first party cookie in the user's browser and communicated in a general way to the host site and Tealium. For Power Opt-In there is also a 3rd party cookie stored on a second domain to share information between sites.

=== Why is there no native app support?

Native mobile apps are very customized concerning technology stack and implementation of tracking and advertising. Therefore, the OIL project won't offer a generic solution for this purpose.

Consents both on desktop or mobile browsers given by the user can't be used in the mobile app for two technical reasons:
* mobile browsers and in app web views use different ressources to store their cookies
* desktop browsers and mobile apps have no physical connections
