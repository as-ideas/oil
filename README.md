## About oil.js

The OIL project aims for a stable cross-company solution for the challenges the GDPR and new EU ePrivacy Regulation will pose to websites and publishers.

![mobile-demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/as-ideas/oil/master/src/assets/images/readme/mobile-demo.gif)

* **Privacy by design & default**: Data privacy opt-in overlay for all users - it supports implicit and explicit modes of consent.
* **Standardized**: Supports the [IAB specification](https://github.com/InteractiveAdvertisingBureau/GDPR-Transparency-and-Consent-Framework) which defines how a vendor should communicate with a Consent Management Provider (CMP, like oil.js) to gather consent information before running any data processing. That API is a set of JavaScript functions. You can find more at the official website http://advertisingconsent.eu/
* **Cross-Domain** It not only supports domain opt-in (called "Site Opt-In", SOI), but also group-based cross-domain opt-in (called "Power Opt-In", POI) [More info here](#poi-and-soi)
* **Lightweight & fast**: oil.js is less than 20 kB of JavaScript (minified + gzipped) and uses asynchronous loading so that your users won't notice any difference when using it
* **Mobile-friendly and compatible with all modern browsers** Works on 99,9% of all devices and browsers, even IE9 and Android 4
* **AMP Support**: Example integration for amp-consent integration included
* **Easy to customize**: You can change the stylesheet, configure everything or access the functionality directly via Javascript as well
* **User-friendly**: Supports advanced settings with a detailed cookie preference center (CPC)

The Opt-In Layer (OIL) is an offical [Consent Management Provider (CMP)](http://advertisingconsent.eu/cmp-list/) after the IAB Europe "Transparency & Consent Framework". Registered with ID 80.

## Usage

There are 3 parts: 

1) Add the CMP stub to your HTML (this makes the loading of a CMP independent from any call by vendors)
2) Add the oil.js configuration to your website
3) Add the script-tag for oil.js to your website


Your custom configuration, this is an incomplete example:

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "timeout": -1,
  "locale": {
    "localeId": "enEN_01",
    "version": 1,
    "texts": {
      "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc.",
      "label_intro": "This site uses cookies. By continuing to use this site, closing this banner, or clicking \"I Agree\", you agree to the use of cookies. Read our <a href=\"//www.businessinsider.com/cookies-policy\" target=\"_blank\">cookies policy</a> and <a href=\"//www.businessinsider.com/privacy-policy\" target=\"_blank\">privacy statement</a> for more information."
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

You need to add the CMP stub (a small script which stores all requests until the full script is loaded) and the script itself:

```javascript
<script>
!function(e){var n={};function t(o){if(n[o])return n[o].exports;var r=n[o]={i:o,l:!1,exports:{}};return e[o].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,t),r.l=!0,r.exports}t.m=e,t.c=n,t.d=function(e,n,o){t.o(e,n)||Object.defineProperty(e,n,{configurable:!1,enumerable:!0,get:o})},t.r=function(e){Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},t.n=function(e){var n=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return t.d(n,"a",n),n},t.o=function(e,n){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,n)},t.p="/",t(t.s=115)}({115:function(e,n,t){"use strict";!function(e,n){e.__cmp||(e.__cmp=function(){function t(e){if(e){var t=!0,r=n.querySelector('script[type="application/configuration"]#oil-configuration');if(null!==r&&r.text)try{var a=JSON.parse(r.text);a&&a.hasOwnProperty("gdpr_applies_globally")&&(t=a.gdpr_applies_globally)}catch(e){}e({gdprAppliesGlobally:t,cmpLoaded:o()},!0)}}function o(){return!(!e.AS_OIL||!e.AS_OIL.commandCollectionExecutor)}var r=[],a=function(n,a,c){if("ping"===n)t(c);else{var i={command:n,parameter:a,callback:c};r.push(i),o()&&e.AS_OIL.commandCollectionExecutor(i)}};return a.commandCollection=r,a.receiveMessage=function(n){var a=n&&n.data&&n.data.__cmpCall;if(a)if("ping"===a.command)t(function(e,t){var o={__cmpReturn:{returnValue:e,success:t,callId:a.callId}};n.source.postMessage(o,n.origin)});else{var c={callId:a.callId,command:a.command,parameter:a.parameter,event:n};r.push(c),o()&&e.AS_OIL.commandCollectionExecutor(c)}},function(n){(e.attachEvent||e.addEventListener)("message",function(e){n.receiveMessage(e)},!1)}(a),function e(){if(!(n.getElementsByName("__cmpLocator").length>0))if(n.body){var t=n.createElement("iframe");t.style.display="none",t.name="__cmpLocator",n.body.appendChild(t)}else setTimeout(e,5)}(),a}())}(window,document)}});
</script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://unpkg.com/@ideasio/oil.js/release/current/oil.<version>-RELEASE.min.js"></script>
```

## Configuration

### Hosting: It is recommended to host all files on your own webspace or CDN!

Here is an [example](https://oil.axelspringer.com/demos/open-source-example.html) how to configure oil.js with selfhosted files. All you need to do is upload the complete content of any release folder, like this folder from [v1.1.2](https://github.com/as-ideas/oil/tree/master/release/1.1.2). All these files are for example uploaded to ``https//your.cdn.com/lib/oil/1.1.2/`` and you can now configure your public path.

### Configuration values

Your configuration is added to your page via a script tag, for example: 

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "timeout": -1,
  "locale": {
    "localeId": "enEN_01",
    "version": 1,
    "texts": {
      "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

| timeout | Value in seconds until the opt-in layer will be automatically hidden. 0 or lower deactivates auto-hide. | 60

### Texts & Locale Object

The locale object must contain at least "localeId" and "version" along with the localized texts in the `texts` property.
LocaleId and version will be stored with the consent cookie so we can keep track of which explicit text version consent was granted for.
There are three options to pass a locale configuration into your application:

* Store your locale object as 'locale' in the oil.js configuration (lowest priority)

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "locale": {
    "localeId": "enEN_01",
    "version": 1,
    "texts": {
      "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
    }
  }
}
</script>
```

* Write your locale object directly to AS_OIL.CONFIG.LOCALE (middle priority)

```javascript
<script>
(function () {
    if (!window.AS_OIL) {
      window.AS_OIL = {};
      window.AS_OIL.CONFIG = {}
    }
    window.AS_OIL.CONFIG.locale = {
      "localeId": "enEN_01",
      "version": 1,
      "texts": {
        "label_intro_heading": "Insider, Inc."
      }
    };
  }()
)
</script>
```

* Return a JSON object from your server through locale_url configuration parameter (highest priority)

```javascript
<script id="oil-configuration" type="application/configuration">
{
  "timeout": -1,
  "locale_url": "//www.yoursite.com/locale.json"
}
</script>
```

### Available text labels

}
```
Labels starting with `label_cpc_purpose_N` are automatically derived from the vendor list if missing from your locale object.

## POI and SOI

### POI – Power Opt-In

In order to retrieve consent and *share it across multiple websites and domains* you will need to activate the __Power Opt-In__ aka POI. 

To instantiate oil.js with POI activated, make up a name for your company group (in the example below `MyGroupName` is used), then follow these steps:

* Setup a server where the consent cookie is stored. For example `any.domain.com`.
* Upload `hub.html` from the `./release` folder, resulting in `https://any.domain.com/hub.html`
* Create a `MyGroupName.json` and upload it in a subfolder named `poi-lists` to your server, resulting in `https://any.domain.com/poi-lists/MyGroupName.json`. Note the file name must be the same as the value passed in poi_group_name. See the [POI-List section](#the-poi-list) for an example.
* Make sure the `MyGroupName.json` is served with the right CORS-headers so that your websites are allowed to read it.
* Add the required parameters to each website configuration that should share the consent cookie:
```javascript
  "poi_activate_poi": true,
  "poi_hub_origin": "//any.domain.com",
  "poi_hub_path": "/hub.html",
  "poi_group_name": "MyGroupName"
```

A single consent cookie will now be shared across sites that use the same `poi_hub_origin` and `poi_group_name` values. You can have multiple groups on the same domain.

You are legally obliged to list all websites/companies belonging to one group.

#### The POI-List

A POI-List file must be a json containing an object with a single property `companyList`. CompanyList must be an array of company names. 

```javascript
{
"companyList":
  [
    "Foo Comp",
    "Bar Inc."
  ]
}
```


### SOI - Single Opt-In

If you want to implement oil.js on a single site you only need the __Site Opt-In__ aka SOI. It stores a user's opt-in permit for the current site only. Default setting. Also known as domain opt-in.

## Styling

The is a detailed section about styling in the documentation. You can edit the design to your likings. Here are some examples:
